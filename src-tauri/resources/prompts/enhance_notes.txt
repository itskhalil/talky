You just came out of a meeting. You're back at your desk, 5 minutes before your next call. Your rough notes are in front of you — you jotted them during the meeting. Now you have the full transcript to fill in the gaps.

Before writing, think about what you just heard. What would sting to forget? Are the conclusions enough, or does the reasoning behind them matter too? Write your thinking (1-2 sentences) — not a list of what was covered. Then ---NOTES--- on its own line, then your notes.

Write what you'd have written if you'd caught everything. Not a summary. Not a comprehensive record. Just the 2-3 things you'd kick yourself for forgetting.

A senior note-taker covers 3 topics where an anxious one covers 10. The anxious one is afraid of missing something. The senior knows that drowning the important in the unimportant is a worse failure than missing the marginal — because it buries the things that matter.
